I've been looking at the ROI types used by the Zeiss AvioVision ZVI
and TIFF/XML formats, basically learning what types are available and
how they work, so I can work out how to represent them in the current
OME ROI model.  I've attached a summary of the different available
shape types.  They are split into two major categories, "annotations"
(which are just overlaid shapes) and "measurements" (which are exactly
the same, but contain additional feature lists of measurements to
overlay onto the images, and to store in results tables).  Some more
specialised types such as LUT/gradient shapes are for annotation only,
not making sense for measurement.

I've not yet found out what every single shape type is--I've got the
existing list mainly by generating the XML shape elements and
observing the results, plus by creating a subset directly in
AxioVision itself. But this is dependent upon AxioVision supporting
all the shape types (some might be optional extensions), and the XML
being valid.  This notwithstanding, we now support all the basic types
supported by AxioVision, plus some more.  Types relating to 3D,
timeseries and channels are not yet figured out.

It would be great if these could be represented directly in the
model. Some types such as the circle, caliper, distance and angle
types are displayed as compound objects which can be represented as a
union of existing types.  However, the semantic meaning of what the
association of objects represents would be lost, so it would be great
if we could perhaps implement a set of annotations to retain this.  I
guess editors such as insight would then be able to edit and interact
with them meaningfully.  Types such as the Profile annotation do need
direct client support to display correctly, though we could
potentially save the profile in the metadata it would be rather
difficult to create during import.

To follow up on this, this details some "nice to have" features which
would let the Zeiss types be represented in the model visually (but
not as editable objects in their own right):

The axiovision curve type is most likely a natural cubic spline, the
curve passing smoothly through all points, but without local control.
It is simply represented as a list of points through which the curve
must pass; there are no additional control points.  Depending upon if
they are doing any custom stuff, it might not be possible to represent
with pixel-perfect accuracy.

Curves might be more generally applicable to other formats, and useful
in their own right.  It might be worth considering adding a spline
type with local control where the curve passes straight through the
control points such as Catmull-Rom splines.  This would make it very
simple for non-experts to fit smooth lines while annotating their
images.

In order to annotate text next to measurements, it would be ideal if
it were possible to control text placement and orientation.  Currently
the coordinate of the first letter is required.  However, it would be
nicer if the text could be also placed to the right of the point or
centred on the point.  And additionally, to the top, middle or bottom
for vertical placement.  Rotation would also be useful, though it's
probably achievable indirectly via the transformation matrix, i.e. you
would effectively have these anchors for placement, where 1 is the
current behaviour.

   7      8      9
   4Text h5ere...6
   1      2      3

This is needed to e.g. align text along measurement lines.  Having a
rotation angle specified directly would also save the need for complex
calculations to work out the rotation origin and transform every time
you want to just place a label along a line.  It also makes it
possible to place text in the centre of a shape.

LUT/gradient boxes are quite specialist.  However, they are also quite
common in published figures, so it would make sense to have a general
implementation.  These are particularly useful when you have false
colour heat maps where you need a visual scale to interpret the
figure.  We already support LUTs, so this is really just a view of the
LUT for a given channel inside a rectangle.

Line profiles are quite common.  But I guess supporting this would
depend upon whether you classify the profile as the result of analysis
of a ROI, or part of a ROI.  It might be handy to be able to overlay a
line profile as a set of coloured polylines, for example.

For the Zeiss types, we can represent these in the model using:
Event/Events: Point or union of Points
Line: Line with end marker(s)
Caliper/Multiple Caliper: union of Lines
Distance/Multiple Distance: union of Lines
Angle3/Angle4: union of two Lines with end markers
Circle: union of Ellipse and Line
Scale Bar: Line (with end markers)
Polyline [open]: Polyline
Aligned Rectangle: Rectangle (or Polygon)
Rotated Rectangle: Polygon (or Rectangle with transform)
Ellipse: Ellipse
Polyline [closed]: Polygon
Text: Text
Length: union of Lines
Spline [open]: (Needs spline type)
Spline [closed]: (Needs spline type)
LUT: (Needs gradient type).  Could be represented as a stack of filled
  rectangles plus text labels
Profile: Can't be represented directly without client support; for now
  would simply be a Line.

Annotations don't typically have labels (with the exception of scale
bars).  Measurements would have one or more labels in the union as
well displaying the value(s) of the measurement.

Some additional information derived from the Zeiss formats:

The ROIs (Shapes) are contained within Layers.  This means you can have sets of ROIs in different layers.  AFAICT the UI only uses a single layer, but uses separate layers for during- and post-acquisition.  But in the file format one may define arbitary numbers of layers to act as a grouping mechanism for ROIs.

WRT the types I outlined in the earlier emails, some may be created in a variety of different ways, and it would make sense to store how the shape was defined, because it records how the measurement was made by the user, which may have implications in further analysis and/or verification that the measurement was correct.

Event/Events: A simple list of points.
  The point size/style/colour may be changed to permit different sets to be distinguished.

Caliper/Distance/Multi-Caliper/Multi-Distance.
  These are all the same measurement(s), a baseline followed by a list of points.  The measurement is the distance from each point to the baseline.  The differences between the types are solely the visual presentation of the measurements.

Angle3/Angle4.
  These measure the angle between two lines.  Angle4 is two separate lines, while Angle3 is two lines with a common point (i.e. a special case of Angle4).  Angle3 could be represented with a three-point polyline.  Angle4 would need to be two separate lines.  Given that Angle3 is a special case of Angle4, it's not clear that it should be represented as a polyline.

Circle.  While the OME model represents this as an ellipse with equal x and y radii, there are three ways to represent a circle here:
- radius defined as a line from centre to edge
- radius defined as a line from edge to centre (stored as the first type with the point order reversed)
- circumference defined using three points.
The first two are representable in the model as an ellipse plus a line.
The latter is representable as an ellipse plus three points.

Polyline is directly translatable.

Aligned Rectangle is directly translatable as a rectangle (with some trivial differences in coordinates).  However, additional tags define metadata to display inside the rectangle (optional) such as channel/slide/acquisition time/exposure time/etc.  The verbatim text can be put into a Label, but the specific meaning would be lost--this is an overlay which would change as you navigate through a stack or timecourse etc, varying with the plane-specific parameters.  While the specific tags would be retained, a more generic means to overlay image- and plane-specific OME metadata might be generally useful within the context of the OME model.

Ellipse is directly translatable.

Outline/closed polyline is directly translatable.

Text is convertible to Label.  However, the OME Label type lacks the alignment attributes mentioned in my earlier mail.  This makes it difficult to control the placement of text in complex compound ROIs.

Length is a single line distance measurement line like, but with additional end lines to make it like a technical drawing line outside the object itself, i.e.

|******OBJECT*******|
|                   |
|<----------------->|
        50 µm

Representable in the model as a simple line, across OBJECT, but with loss of the other lines.  It's representable as three separate lines, but with loss of the context of the specific measurement.

Open and closed splines: these are probably natural splines (not Bezier).  ZVI currently stores them as polylines given that we don't support splines.  But having a spline type would permit them to be stored.

LUT and Profile: Covered in previous mail.

I've been thinking about how we might store and interact with more complex compound ROI types.  This is just some thoughts on that; comments (and/or abuse) welcome!


Storing and manipulating complex compound objects
=================================================

With these measurements, one thing perhaps worth considering is that there are up to four types of object here:
1) Result context.  The object(s) representing the physical measurement.  This is what we currently store in the model.
2) Measurement context: line along radius of circle, points along circumference of circle etc.  This is "how the measurement was made"
3) Visual context: such as visual cues such as construction lines.  This is the visual presentation of the measurement to the viewer.
4) Editing context: values which control the placement of the above. Information for generation of UI manipulation handles, and of the other contexts while editing.

We can represent the actual measurements in most cases using the existing ROI types.  However, if we store the additional types, it's no longer possible to distinguish between the measurement and the additional context.

If it was possible to distinguish between these in the model, it would be possible for the objects to be displayed without any advanced knowledge of how an object should be edited.  It would also be possible to extract the primitive measurement values.  However, the measurement context would provide additional information to editors for manupulation of the object, which would then be able to update all three contexts appropriately.

Doing this would provide a simple but effective means for additional ROI types to be added without requiring support in all programs displaying/modifying ROIs.  This does not of course replace the need for namespaces to identify ROI categories, but it does supplement it by allowing programs to selectively display different contexts without any knowledge of the underlying type.

As an example, using this length measurement:

   |******OBJECT*******|
   |                   |
   |<----------------->|
           50 µm


1) Result context

   #******OBJECT*******#

   (where the #s are the start and end points of a Line at either end of the object.  This is the value of the physical measurement.)

2) Measurement context

   No additional information needed in this case.

3) Visual context

   |                   |
   |                   |
   |<----------------->|
           50 µm

   Three lines, one with arrow end markers, plus text label.
   This is the visual representation of the measurement.

4) Editing context

   #******OBJECT*******
   #
   #

   (where the #s represent a distance between the measured line and the drawn line in the visual context.  This information is used to generate the visual context from the measurement context.)


I hope the above doesn't sound too way out.  But the current system is
limited to storing only the first of these four contexts, which loses
information.  While it's possible to delegate all of the presentation
and editing to the viewer, the reality is that this is stuff people
want.  If I'm annotating an image for a paper, I want the annotations
to appear exactly the same as I see them if I send them to someone
else. And if I'm doing physical measurements, I want the specifics of
how I made the measurement to be recorded.  All we are doing here is
providing additional information to the viewer/editor that it is free
to use and/or ignore as it chooses.

I've attached a copy of some simple figures to illustrate what I was
trying to articulate below.  This takes some relatively simple
measurements, and breaks them down into the four different contexts.

Thinking about this a little more, in many cases it will be possible
to omit some contexts and infer them from the others. For example, if
I have a simple line I will store a line in the result context.  The
measurement context is the same two points, and so we may simply use
the result context points in its place.  Likewise, if the measurement
is a simple one, the visual context may be omitted and inferred from
the result context also.  The different contexts really only come into
play when we want a more sophisticated visual representation (for
example with overlaid textual representations of the measurement value
or to visualise the measurement in a more complex manner than the
result context alone can provide).  And they are essential when using
more complex compound ROIs as the last example attached shows.

In the last example, all the information is provided to allow the user
to edit the object in a UI.  For example, they can adjust the end
points of the baseline, and the start points of the lines in the
measurement context can be retriangulated from the end points and
baseline.  The measurement context can be inferred from the endpoints
of the lines in the result context.  And the endpoints can also be
adjusted independently.  Following any adjustment, the updated
baseline can be stored in the editing context, the measurement lines
in the measurement context, and the visual representation in the
visual context.  The visual context is shown here to include end
markers on the distance lines, and text labels with the measured
values.  But these could be toggled on or off and the settings stored
in an annotation specific for this measurement type--there's really no
limit to the "extra stuff" you can add here, but the basic measurement
remains the same in the result context.

(In this example, the baseline could actually be in the measurement
context, since it's part of the measurement; the first example is a
better illustration of the editing context.)

The important point is that anyone should be able to open the file and
display the visual representation without any knowledge of the
specifics of the ROI type or measurements being made.  Likewise they
can also look at the measured distances in the results context and use
them without any knowledge of how they were measured.  Only a UI which
supports the ROI type in question will need to use the editing and/or
measurements context, and they will know how to regenerate the other
contexts when editing.

I have attached a copy of some comparions between ROIs in 2D, 3D and
nD (plus 2D-extruded where possible, which we kind of support with our
current method of allowing a ROI to be composed of multiple 2D shapes
distributed through a z stack).  You might need to zoom in to see the
detail.

As discussed in the previous mail, this shows the 3D and nD
equivalents of our current primitives, plus a few others which might
be nice to support, e.g. arcs and distances.  I've not included
complex 3D volumes as meshes because I can't draw them, likewise with
3D spline surfaces! But they should probably also be there.

One consideration is that for quite a number of the shapes, it's
possible to support 3D and nD very simply--we just increase the number
of dimensions in each vertex, and that's it (obviously just for
storage; it will still require some work for rendering).  From the
point of view of storing the list of vertices, it would be nice if we
could specify the dimensions being used e.g. XZT, and then allow
missing dimensions to be specified as constants as we now do for theZ.
This would keep the representation quite compact--we don't really want
a separate element for each vertex since for complex shapes
e.g. meshes we'll be using multi-megabytes of XML markup for no good
reason.

Supporting 2D primitives in 3D and nD: While it would be possible to
translate and rotate using a 4×4 matrix, it would be nice if we could
e.g. just use an nD unit vector which can specify a rotation in
arbitrary dimensions [we can trivially construct a matrix rotation
transform from the vector].  However, note that while current
transforms occur only in 2D, where the x and y pixel sizes are
typically the same, this is not usually the case in z or higher
dimensions, and so the transformations may need doing in physical
units; so adding proper support for units would also be desirable to
fully support 3D transforms.  Note that this would also solve the
existing problem in 2D that prevents ellipses and rectangles being
rotated (without the use of a matrix transform), though where the
rotation centre should be may be shape- and context-dependent.  We
could default the unit vector to (0,0,-1) which would specify the
existing behaviour.

Alternative representations: One problem I have with the current ROI
model is that there is only one way to describe each shape.  e.g. a
polyline can only be described as a series of points; it might in some
cases be more natural to specify one as a starting point and a series
of vectors; while either are fine just to draw the ROI, it would (IMO)
be very desirable for the purposes of measuring to store what was
measured, since converting it to a canonical representation is lossy,
and removes the original measurements, and hence the intent of the
original annotation.  This applies to other shapes as well.  For
example, a circle or ellipse can be described by a bounding box (which
may itself be a point and one or two vectors, or a set of points), or
by a point and radius or half-axes, or by the Mahalanobis distance
(typically for computing from a normal distribution of points).  For a
cylinder/cone, we can specify this in multiple ways also from a
circle/ellipse plus length, or point plus vector (length and
direction) plus radius (or half-axes).

The point with the above is that the current model is focussed on
drawing shapes, while making measurements involves drawing only for
visualisation; the important parts are the values for making the
measurement, and of course the results.  Some programs
(e.g. AxioVision) have completely separate sets of objects for drawing
(annotation) and measurement.  These are a largely overlapping set,
but the former are not used for any length/area/volume/pixel
measurements.  Objects such as scale bars and labels are for drawing
only.

ROI relationships: When segmenting cell contents, shown as cytoplasm,
actin filaments, nucleus and nucleolus, these fall into a strict
heirarchy (a nucleus can only be in one cell, though one cell could
have more than one nucleus).  If we added a ROI type that was a
container of ROIs (note: not a union), and added a means of
classifying ROIs with tags/labels, this would be very useful for HCS
and other types of analysis.  Additionally, some relationships are not
hierarchial, e.g. tree-like branching and merging in a vessel bed, but
could be represented if a ROI could point to one or more other ROIs,
which would permit a directed graph of relationships between ROIs.

There's still quite a lot of things which need careful consideration
for 3D ROIs, but hopefully this is useful for further discussion.
